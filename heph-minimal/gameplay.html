<p>As you can see in the screenshot, Hephaestus is divided into two areas: a map
display and a scrolling icon+text panel.  The map only shows squares that are
visible from your current position - if a square is not visible, it is filled in
with black; if it's only partially visible, it's greyed-out.</p>

<br clear="right" />

<p>Hephaestus is entirely keyboard-controlled:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Ctrl-N = New Adventure</b></dt>
    <dd>Starts a new adventure.  You will be shown a file dialog, and can choose
    any ".adv" adventure file.  Your current game will be lost unless you save
    it!</dd>

<dt><b>Ctrl-L = Load Saved Game</b></dt>
    <dd>Loads a saved game.  You will be shown a file dialog, and can choose any
    ".sav" save file; you must have the ".adv" adventure file in the same
    directory.  Your current game will be lost unless you save it!</dd>

<dt><b>Ctrl-S = Save Game</b></dt>
    <dd>Saves your current game.  You will be shown a file dialog, and can
    select a new ".sav" save file to create, or write over an old one.</dd>

<dt><b>Ctrl-Q = Quit Game</b></dt>
    <dd>Quits the current game.</dd>

<dt><b>Ctrl-A = About</b></dt>
    <dd>Shows a dialog with copyright information and the URL of the
    <a href="http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/Hephaestus/">Hephaestus home page</a>.</dd>

<dt><b>F1</b></dt>
    <dd>Lists all of the gameplay keys below in the text panel.</dd>

<dt><b>k, UP    = North</b></dt>
<dt><b>h, RIGHT = East</b></dt>
<dt><b>j, DOWN  = South</b></dt>
<dt><b>l, LEFT  = West</b></dt>
    <dd>You can move in four directions with the arrow keys or the Rogue keys
    hjkl.
    <ul>
    <li>Move into an enemy to attack it.</li>

    <li>Move into a friendly creature to talk to it.</li>

    <li>Move into a stationary object to trigger it, if it can be triggered.</li>

    <li>Hold down shift along with a move key to turn to face in that direction.
    The sprites for North and East are the same, as are those for South and
    West, but you do have four facings.  Facing only matters for ranged and
    magic attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    </dd>

<dt><b>a = Attack Ahead</b></dt>
    <dd>If you have a ranged attack, you can attack anything ahead of you within
    range; your Range stat shows the number of squares ahead you can
    attack.  You must be facing in the correct direction, either by last moving
    that direction or by hitting shift and a move key together.
    <p>You do not need to use 'a' to make melee attacks - just move into the
    target.</p>
    </dd>

<dt><b>d = Drop Item</b></dt>
    <dd>Allows you to select a single item from your inventory and drop it in
    your current square.</dd>

<dt><b>e = Equip Item</b></dt>
    <dd>Allows you to select a single equippable item from your inventory and
    ready it; if you already have an item of the same type equipped, it will be
    removed automatically.  Equipment increases your stats as long as you have
    it ready - weapons increase your Attack stat, armor increases your Defense
    stat, and so on.  There are five equipment positions:
    <ul>
    <li>Weapon</li>
    <li>Shield</li>
    <li>Armor</li>
    <li>Hat</li>
    <li>Accessory</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>

<dt><b>g = Get Item</b></dt>
    <dd>Picks up all items in your current square.  You have an unlimited
    inventory.</dd>

<dt><b>i = Inventory</b></dt>
    <dd>Lists all items and equipment carried in the text panel.</dd>

<dt><b>m = Magic</b></dt>
    <dd>Allows you to select one of your known magic spells and activate it if
    you have enough MagicPoints (MP).  If the spell is ranged, you must be
    facing in the correct direction, either by last moving that direction or by
    hitting shift and a move key together.  Magic spells are defined by the
    adventure writer, and they can have almost any effect imaginable.</dd>

<dt><b>r = Remove Equip</b></dt>
    <dd>Allows you to select one of your equipped items and remove it - you lose
    the stat bonuses from that item, but now you can drop the item or equip
    another item there instead.</dd>

<dt><b>t = Trigger (item on ground)</b></dt>
    <dd>Triggers a non-blocking item that you are standing over.  If there are
    multiple items, the top-most item that can be triggered will be chosen - be
    careful!  Trigger is most often used to close doors - stand over the door,
    trigger it, and move off to either side; you can open doors by just running
    into them.</dd>

<dt><b>u = Use Item</b></dt>
    <dd>Allows you to select one of your items and trigger it.  This is most
    often used to use food, potions, wands, and the like.  The effects are
    defined by the adventure writer, and anything can happen.</dd>

<dt><b>w = Wait</b></dt>
    <dd>Stand still for a turn.</dd>

<h2><a name="character">Character</a></h2>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>There are 4 primary stats and 9 secondary stats.  Each stat ranges from 1 to
20 for "normal people" at level 1, but there is no upper limit.  Each stat has
two scores: a current value and a maximum value, usually written <tt>"current /
maximum"</tt>.  Your current value can never exceed your maximum, but your
maximum can be increased...</p>

<dt><b>Body</b></dt>
    <dd>Strength, physique, and toughness.  Body determines your starting
    Attack and HitPoints.  You will die if your Body reaches 0!</dd>

<dt><b>Speed</b></dt>
    <dd>Reaction speed, agility, and manual dexterity.  Speed determines your
    starting Evade.  You will die if your Speed reaches 0!</dd>

<dt><b>Mind</b></dt>
    <dd>Intelligence and perception.  Mind determines your starting MagicPoints
    and MagicAbility.  You will die if your Mind reaches 0!</dd>

<dt><b>Presence</b></dt>
    <dd>Charisma, appearance, and force of personality.  Presence determines
    your starting MagicEvade.  You will die if your Presence reaches 0!</dd>

<dt><b>HitPoints (HP)</b></dt>
    <dd>The amount of damage you can take before dying.  When you reach 0 HP,
    the game is over, so keep an eye on this stat in combat!  HP can be
    recovered by magic spells, sleeping in an inn, or using items like healing
    potions.</dd>

<dt><b>MagicPoints (MP)</b></dt>
    <dd>The amount of power you have left to activate magic spells.  MP can be
    recovered by sleeping in an inn or using items like magic potions.</dd>

<dt><b>Attack</b></dt>
    <dd>Your ability to strike an enemy successfully.  Attack determines both
    your chance to hit and the amount of damage you do, and is countered by your
    target's Evade and Defense.</dd>

<dt><b>Evade</b></dt>
    <dd>Your ability to avoid enemy attacks.</dd>

<dt><b>Defense</b></dt>
    <dd>Your ability to absorb damage, usually gained from armor.</dd>

<dt><b>Range</b></dt>
    <dd>The distance you can attack at, usually gained from missile
    weapons.</dd>

<dt><b>MagicAbility</b></dt>
    <dd>Your effectiveness at using magic.  Many spells depend on your
    MagicAbility to determine what happens; in the sample adventure, Fire
    Arrow's damage and Heal Self's healing are 25% of your MagicAbility.  More
    powerful spells (costing more MP) would have higher percentages.  In any
    magic attack, your MagicAbility is resisted by the target's MagicEvade, and
    then the damage, determined separately, is resisted by MagicDefense.</dd>

<dt><b>MagicEvade</b></dt>
    <dd>Your ability to avoid magical attacks.  Unlike physical Evade,
    MagicEvade is an all-or-nothing attempt - if you fail, the spell takes full
    effect.</dd>

<dt><b>MagicDefense</b></dt>
    <dd>Your ability to absorb damage from magical attacks.  This is very rare;
    only certain artifacts should give any MagicDefense.</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Your Level indicates how experienced you are.  You will start at Level 1, and
there is no upper limit - it's quite plausible to have over a hundred levels
after a long adventure.</p>

<p>By killing enemies and completing quests, you gain experience.  Typically you
will earn 1-10 experience points (XP) per level equivalent of the enemy
depending on the challenge, or up to half your level's worth for a quest (any
adventure writer who gives you more than that is Monty Hall...).</p>

<p>When you have 100&times;(current level) XP, those XP are spent, your level
increases by 1, one of your primary stats, all of the secondary stats based on
it, your HitPoints and MagicPoints increase by 1, and you are fully healed.
Note that if your Body improves, your HitPoints increase by 2, and if your Mind
improves, your MagicPoints increase by 2.</p>

<p>Experience may also be used in an adventure to purchase magic spells or for
special training.  Levels have no other standard effect, but might be used as a
requirement for a quest.</p>

<p>In the sample adventure, the endless supplies of bunnies are worth 1 XP each
(they're harmless unless you corner them, then watch out!) and the hillbilly
goons are worth 5 XP each (they're a bit weaker than you, especially once you
get the spear, but they might get a lucky shot in), so it will take a while to
gain levels there.  In real adventures, you won't face such weak monsters, and
you will earn much greater rewards - in Hades.adv, dragons are worth 2000 XP,
and you'll have to earn every point of it!</p>
